# hello-world
My first repository
Hey all!

This is the first repository I ever made on  GitHub. I am really excited to use GitHub for my Dual Degree Project. I may want to use the offline version, Git, on my laptop as opposed to this online version. But since I do not know much about Git, I am going with the flow.

That's all for now.

May the force be you.
